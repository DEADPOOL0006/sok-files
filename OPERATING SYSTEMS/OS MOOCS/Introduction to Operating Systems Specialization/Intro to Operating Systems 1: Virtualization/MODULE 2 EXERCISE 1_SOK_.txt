int num;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

  
  // add code below this line

Q.3
What happens to num when it is accessed and changed in both the parent and the child processes?

Select an answer and click the button below to submit.


1) The program crashes.


2) The child process retains its own value for x.


3) The child process inherits the variable value of x from the parent, so the variables are the same.


4) The child process returns a NULL value for x.
